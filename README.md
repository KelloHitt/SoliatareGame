            Hi there! Here is my solitare game that I created last year as shown in the file above!


To run the shell, please ensure to close all tkinter and turtle graphics windows after the ‘let’s play’ turtle graphic 
window finishes running (the graphics will no longer run and the ‘Welcome to Solitaire!’ message will be displayed
once it's done running) and then the shell will automatically prompt the user to make a move. Feel free to alter the list of cards at the bottom of the program.
